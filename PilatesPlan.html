            <p id="p1"> Pilates is a low-impact form of exercise that emphasizes controlled movement, core strength, and overall body awareness. It combines elements of physical rehabilitation, breathwork, and precise technique to create a full-body conditioning system. At its core, Pilates focuses on strengthening the deep muscles of the abdomen, back, and pelvis—often referred to as the “powerhouse”—which helps improve posture, balance, and stability.</p>

            <h2 id="workouts">The type of workouts we provide: </h2>
            <!For example: Mat workouts, show a video or photo
            - Reformer workouts, Challenges... Maybe try to make it swipe and be selectable to open like another page or smtn>
            <p>Mat workouts - is especially good for building core strength, improving flexibility, enhancing control, and offering a simple, accessible workout you can do anywhere—while still providing many of the benefits of traditional Pilates. </p>
            <p>Reformer workouts - highly effective because the machine's design adds resistance, support, and versatility, allowing for a deeper, more targeted workout.</p>
